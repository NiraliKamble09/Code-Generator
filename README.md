# Code-Generator
This is a project that deployed local AI models and integrating them with interactive UI tools for coding assistance! 
I have built an AI-powered chatbot that helps users solve coding problems using LangChain and CodeLlama. 
This bot accepts natural language queries, processes them using a structured prompt, retrieves relevant code snippets, and displays them in a Gradio-based interface.
